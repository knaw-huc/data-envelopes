## What is a Data-Envelope?
A Data-Envelope is a description of a cultural heritage dataset that enables users to more easily find the dataset and make responsible use of it. For more details, read [The data-envelope concept](concept.md).

## Why do we need data-envelopes?
Cultural heritage datasets are very interesting to humanities researchers, machine learning researchers and members of the public. At the same time, these datasets often have a complex history, may be missing data, contain biases or offensive language and may be difficult to use. Data-envelopes aim to carefully document these complexities and include examples of how to use the dataset responsibly. This makes it easier to find and use cultural heritage datasets.

## Didn't someone else already do this?
In tests with cultural heritage datasets, our researchers found that existing documentation initiatives didn't properly cover the complexity. For this reason, we are extending what has already been done with particular attention to the specific challenges of cultural heritage datasets. 

Data-envelopes build on existing standards such as [DCAT3](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/), and support the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles. 

Data-envelopes are being developed by the [Huygens Institute](https://www.huygens.knaw.nl), in conjunction with the broader cultural heritage community. We are in touch with related initiatives.
