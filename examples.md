This page gives an overview of example data-envelopes, followed by plots of the temporal coverage of the datasets described in the data-envelopes.
## Overview
Here is an overview of example data-envelopes. If a data-envelope is publicly available then a link to the data-envelope is included.

These are real-life examples, filled in by a variety of different people from different institutes, and as such they reflect a diversity of choices in how to fill in a data-envelope. They are intended to help you think about what works well (and what doesn't) for different datasets. They are not intended as model examples that you should try to copy.
